description: Create a full HyperPod cluster from scratch, including EKS creation, dependency configuration, and HyperPod provisioning. Use when creating a new cluster, setting up HyperPod infrastructure, bootstrapping environment.
---

## Overview

Full pipeline: EKS Cluster → Switch → Install Dependencies → Create HyperPod

Each step is async and requires polling until completion before proceeding. Users can start from any step if prior steps are already done.

## Resume from Previous Session

If user says "continue" or "resume cluster creation", detect current progress before starting:

1. Call `cluster_get_eks_creation_status` — if a cluster is still creating, resume polling from Step 1
2. Call `cluster_list_all` and `cluster_get_status` — check which cluster is active
3. Call `cluster_get_dependency_status` — if not configured, resume from Step 3
4. Call `hyperpod_get_creation_status` — if HyperPod is creating, resume polling from Step 4

Report the detected state to the user and confirm before continuing.

## Step 1: Create EKS Cluster

1. Call `cluster_list_all` to check for existing clusters
2. Only ask user for cluster tag. Do NOT ask about region — always use the current region by omitting the region parameter. Only ask region if the user explicitly mentions wanting a different region.
3. Check if user provided custom CIDR configuration:
   - **If user provided all 6 CIDRs** (vpcCidr, publicSubnet1Cidr, publicSubnet2Cidr, eksPrivateSubnet1Cidr, eksPrivateSubnet2Cidr, hyperPodPrivateSubnetCidr): call `cluster_create_eks_with_cidr` with all 6 CIDRs plus clusterTag and region
   - **Otherwise**: call `cluster_create_eks` with just the clusterTag (CIDR auto-generated)
   - Do NOT proactively ask user about CIDR. Only use `cluster_create_eks_with_cidr` when user explicitly provides CIDR values.
4. Inform user: estimated wait 8-12 minutes
5. Poll `cluster_get_eks_creation_status` every **120 seconds** until stack status is `CREATE_COMPLETE`. Between each poll, call `wait_seconds(120)` to wait.
6. If status contains `FAILED` or `ROLLBACK`, report error and stop

## Step 2: Switch to New Cluster and Verify

1. Call `cluster_switch` with the new cluster tag
2. Call `cluster_get_status` to verify the switch was successful
3. Confirm the returned cluster info matches the newly created cluster (check cluster name/tag)
4. If verification fails, report error and stop

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

1. Call `cluster_configure_dependencies`
2. Inform user: estimated wait 3-5 minutes
3. Poll `cluster_get_dependency_status` every **60 seconds** until `configured: true`. Between each poll, call `wait_seconds(60)` to wait.
4. If status is `failed`, report error and stop

## Step 4: Create HyperPod Cluster

1. Call `cluster_get_availability_zones` and `cluster_get_available_instances` in parallel to get options
2. Ask user to provide the following (show available options from above):
   - **AcceleratedInstanceType**: GPU instance type (e.g. ml.g5.xlarge, ml.p4d.24xlarge)
   - **AcceleratedInstanceCount**: number of instances
   - **availabilityZone**: which AZ to use
   - **Capacity type**: ask whether to use **on-demand** or **Training Plan (reserved capacity)**. If user chooses Training Plan, ask for the **AcceleratedTrainingPlanArn**.
3. Call `hyperpod_create` with user's choices (auto-generate hyperPodTag if user doesn't specify)
4. Inform user: estimated wait 5-15 minutes
5. **MUST poll** `hyperpod_get_creation_status` every **60 seconds** until status is `InService` or failed. Between each poll, call `wait_seconds(60)` to wait. Report each poll result to the user. Do NOT skip polling or leave it to the user to check manually.

## Step 5: Configure S3 Storage

1. Call `s3_storage_create` with no parameters (uses all defaults: s3-claim, auto-detected bucket and region)
2. If successful, inform user that S3 storage is mounted
3. If failed, report error but do NOT block — this is non-critical and can be configured later

## Step 6: Verify

1. Call `cluster_get_status` to show final state (nodes, GPUs)
2. Summarize what was created (EKS cluster, dependencies, HyperPod, S3 storage)

## Rules

- Do NOT ask user about region. Use the current/default region unless user explicitly requests a different one.
- Execute steps strictly in order. Do not proceed until the previous step completes.
- Stop immediately on any failure and report the error clearly.
- Inform user of estimated wait time before each long-running operation.
- Report current status during polling, do not poll silently.
- User can say "start from step N" to skip completed steps.
- Always ask user whether to use on-demand or Training Plan (reserved capacity). Default selection is on-demand, but user must be given the choice.
- After ANY long-running operation starts (EKS creation, dependency install, HyperPod creation), you MUST automatically poll for status. Always call `wait_seconds()` between polls. Never poll without waiting first.
